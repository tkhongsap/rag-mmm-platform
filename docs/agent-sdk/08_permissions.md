# Configure Permissions

> Source: `platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/permissions`

Control how your agent uses tools with permission modes, hooks, and declarative allow/deny rules.

---

The Claude Agent SDK provides permission controls to manage how Claude uses tools. Use permission modes and rules to define what's allowed automatically, and the [`canUseTool` callback](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input) to handle everything else at runtime.

> **Note:** This page covers permission modes and rules. To build interactive approval flows where users approve or deny tool requests at runtime, see [Handle approvals and user input](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input).

## How Permissions Are Evaluated

When Claude requests a tool, the SDK checks permissions in this order:

1. **Hooks** -- Run [hooks](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/hooks) first, which can allow, deny, or continue to the next step
2. **Permission rules** -- Check rules defined in [settings.json](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#permission-settings) in this order: `deny` rules first (block regardless of other rules), then `allow` rules (permit if matched), then `ask` rules (prompt for approval). These declarative rules let you pre-approve, block, or require approval for specific tools without writing code.
3. **Permission mode** -- Apply the active permission mode (`bypassPermissions`, `acceptEdits`, `dontAsk`, etc.)
4. **canUseTool callback** -- If not resolved by rules or modes, call your [`canUseTool` callback](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input) for a decision

This page focuses on **permission modes** (step 3), the static configuration that controls default behavior. For the other steps:

- **Hooks**: run custom code to allow, deny, or modify tool requests. See [Control execution with hooks](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/hooks).
- **Permission rules**: configure declarative allow/deny rules in `settings.json`. See [Permission settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#permission-settings).
- **canUseTool callback**: prompt users for approval at runtime. See [Handle approvals and user input](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input).

## Permission Modes

Permission modes provide global control over how Claude uses tools. You can set the permission mode when calling `query()` or change it dynamically during streaming sessions.

### Available modes

The SDK supports these permission modes:

| Mode | Description | Tool behavior |
|:-----|:------------|:--------------|
| `default` | Standard permission behavior | No auto-approvals; unmatched tools trigger your `canUseTool` callback |
| `acceptEdits` | Auto-accept file edits | File edits and filesystem operations (`mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, etc.) are automatically approved |
| `bypassPermissions` | Bypass all permission checks | All tools run without permission prompts (use with caution) |
| `plan` | Planning mode | No tool execution; Claude plans without making changes |

> **Warning -- Subagent inheritance**: When using `bypassPermissions`, all subagents inherit this mode and it cannot be overridden. Subagents may have different system prompts and less constrained behavior than your main agent. Enabling `bypassPermissions` grants them full, autonomous system access without any approval prompts.

### Set permission mode

You can set the permission mode once when starting a query, or change it dynamically while the session is active.

#### At query time

Pass `permission_mode` (Python) or `permissionMode` (TypeScript) when creating a query. This mode applies for the entire session unless changed dynamically.

```python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions


async def main():
    async for message in query(
        prompt="Help me refactor this code",
        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
            permission_mode="default",  # Set the mode here
        ),
    ):
        if hasattr(message, "result"):
            print(message.result)


asyncio.run(main())
```

```typescript
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

async function main() {
  for await (const message of query({
    prompt: "Help me refactor this code",
    options: {
      permissionMode: "default" // Set the mode here
    }
  })) {
    if ("result" in message) {
      console.log(message.result);
    }
  }
}

main();
```

#### During streaming

Call `set_permission_mode()` (Python) or `setPermissionMode()` (TypeScript) to change the mode mid-session. The new mode takes effect immediately for all subsequent tool requests. This lets you start restrictive and loosen permissions as trust builds, for example switching to `acceptEdits` after reviewing Claude's initial approach.

```python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions


async def main():
    q = query(
        prompt="Help me refactor this code",
        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
            permission_mode="default",  # Start in default mode
        ),
    )

    # Change mode dynamically mid-session
    await q.set_permission_mode("acceptEdits")

    # Process messages with the new permission mode
    async for message in q:
        if hasattr(message, "result"):
            print(message.result)


asyncio.run(main())
```

```typescript
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

async function main() {
  const q = query({
    prompt: "Help me refactor this code",
    options: {
      permissionMode: "default" // Start in default mode
    }
  });

  // Change mode dynamically mid-session
  await q.setPermissionMode("acceptEdits");

  // Process messages with the new permission mode
  for await (const message of q) {
    if ("result" in message) {
      console.log(message.result);
    }
  }
}

main();
```

### Mode Details

#### Accept edits mode (`acceptEdits`)

Auto-approves file operations so Claude can edit code without prompting. Other tools (like Bash commands that aren't filesystem operations) still require normal permissions.

**Auto-approved operations:**

- File edits (Edit, Write tools)
- Filesystem commands: `mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`

**Use when:** you trust Claude's edits and want faster iteration, such as during prototyping or when working in an isolated directory.

#### Bypass permissions mode (`bypassPermissions`)

Auto-approves all tool uses without prompts. Hooks still execute and can block operations if needed.

> **Warning:** Use with extreme caution. Claude has full system access in this mode. Only use in controlled environments where you trust all possible operations.

#### Plan mode (`plan`)

Prevents tool execution entirely. Claude can analyze code and create plans but cannot make changes. Claude may use `AskUserQuestion` to clarify requirements before finalizing the plan. See [Handle approvals and user input](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input#handle-clarifying-questions) for handling these prompts.

**Use when:** you want Claude to propose changes without executing them, such as during code review or when you need to approve changes before they're made.
